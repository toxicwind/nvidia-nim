# Mistral-Nemotron Overview

## Description:

Mistral-Nemotron is a large language model produced by Mistral and optimised by NVIDIA that generates human-like text and can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and text summarization. It is also suitable for Agentic workflows due to its tool calling capabilities.

This model is ready for commercial usage.
